#F451-Project
This is a really simple (and crappy) browser game, made for my English 2 Honors class. It was for the book we had been 
reading, *Fahrenheit 451*, by Ray Bradbury. The initial assignment was to only create a board/card game, but I decided to 
take it one step further by making a "computer" game. This was presented on **March 15, 2016**.
